## More about this project:
Motivated by our findings in an earlier paper (PMID: 24196486), we set out to test the relation between DNA methylation and breast cancer risk factors in a larger cohort of non-diseased breast tissue. Using histologically normal breast tissues samples from healthy donors (Komen Tissue Bank), we profiled genome-wide methylation levels using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray and carried out a reference-free cell-type adjusted Epigenome-Wide Association Study for several breast cancer risk factors.

We validated our discovery findings from the Komen population using a separate smaller population of non-diseased breast tissue (National Disease Research Interchange) and adjacent-to-tumor normal tissue. We then extended these analyses to investigate how these DNA methylation differences associated with risk factors were further disrupted in both pre-invasive and invasive breast cancer. 

## More about the data generated:
